Journal Code Editor is a module for Foundry VTT that allows you to modify the source code of your Journal Entries using Ace editor or [Code Mirror](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/codemirror-lib).

# Installation
In the setup screen, use the URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcanistzed/jce/main/module.json to install the module.

# Usage
Just right click on a journal entry in the sidebar and you will see an option to open it up with the editor. When you are done editing, make sure to click the save button so that you don't lose your changes.
More options such as auto-open, font size or theme can be found in module settings.

## Using Ace
Press Ctrl+Alt+h or Cmd+Alt+h to view a list of all the keyboard shortcuts available. You can access the command palette by pressing F1 while focusing on the editor.

## Using Code Mirror
Install the [Code Mirror](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/codemirror-lib) and enable it, then enable the setting in the JCE module settings.
