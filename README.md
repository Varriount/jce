Journal Code Editor is a module for Foundry VTT that allows you to modify the source code of your Journal Entries using the editor library of your choice.

## Installation

In the setup screen, use the URL `https://github.com/arcanistzed/jce/releases/latest/download/module.json` to install the module.

## Usage

Just right click on a journal entry in the sidebar and you will see an option to toggle opening it with JCE. When you are done editing, make sure to click the save button so that you don't lose your changes.

If you have enabled a supported editor library, you can use them instead of the default textarea. Currently, JCE supports [Ace Editor](https://github.com/arcanistzed/acelib) and [CodeMirror](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/codemirror-lib).
